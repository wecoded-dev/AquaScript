He turned it on, switched the wipers on and off (even though it was a dry summer night), flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn, and then switched on the lights. He moved the car forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained stationary as the other patrons left. Finally, he began to pull out of the parking lot, and the cop stopped him. The cop read him his rights and administered a Breathalyzer test. The results showed that the man was completely sober. \"I don’t understand,\" the cop said. \"Why were you acting drunk?\" The man replied, \"Tonight I’m the designated decoy.\""
